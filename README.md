# Bellabeat: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

## Project Overview
This case study is part of my Data Analytics portfolio. I analyze smart device data from FitBit users to identify usage trends that can help Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, improve its marketing strategy.

## Key Findings
*   **Sedentary Time**: Users average 991 minutes of sedentary time per day.
*   **Activity Levels**: Most users are "Active" (5k-10k steps) but fail to reach the 10,000-step benchmark.
*   **Sleep Gap**: A significant discrepancy exists between time spent in bed and actual sleep duration.

## Strategic Recommendations
1.  **In-App Challenges**: Push "Active" users toward the "Highly Active" tier.
2.  **Vibration Alerts**: Market the 'Leaf' and 'Time' watch for sedentary reminders.
3.  **Sleep Content**: Promote Bellabeat Membership's meditation and sleep hygiene content.
